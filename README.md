This is a dump of all the Powershell scripts that myself and coworkers have developed at our company. This is mostly a backup in case our site goes down.

One thing to note about a lot of these scripts is that NinjaRMM allows us to have custom script variables that are environment variables that are set when the script is run. These may appear as '$env:scriptRunType' or other custom names.
